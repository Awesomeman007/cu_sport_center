# cu_sport_center

I am a part of Thinc. club who has just finished working as a frontend developer on the university sport center reservation web application.
Fortunately, due to the privacy policy, the project is set private and not accessible by other unrelated people. 
Therefore, I couldn't bring that to the stage as a part of my portfolio.
